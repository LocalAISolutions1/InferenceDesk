# InferenceDesk Privacy Policy
**Company:** Local AI Solutions (“Local AI Solutions,” “we,” “us”)  
**Product:** InferenceDesk Desktop Application (the “App”)  
**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0

This Privacy Policy explains how Local AI Solutions collects, uses, and shares information in connection with the InferenceDesk App and related services (collectively, the “Services”).

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the App.

---

## 1) Key Idea: Local-First
InferenceDesk is designed to run inference locally on your computer. In typical use:
- Your prompts, files, and model outputs stay on your device.
- We do not receive your prompts or model outputs unless you explicitly choose a feature that sends data to us (for example, sending a support bundle you generate).

Some features may connect to the internet (for example: update checks, downloading models, fetching a model list, license verification for paid features, or optional crash reporting). This Policy describes those cases.

---

## 2) Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide directly
We may collect information you provide when you:
- Contact support (e.g., email address and the content of your message)
- Submit feedback
- Choose to send diagnostic logs or a support bundle
- Create an account or purchase paid features (if/when available)

### B. Information processed locally on your device
The App may process locally:
- Prompts, chats, text, files, and other inputs you load into the App
- Outputs produced by models
- Model configuration, settings, and local session history (if you enable it)

This information is stored on your device (where applicable). We do not automatically collect it.

### C. Technical data (limited) from network features
If the App performs network actions (such as checking for updates or downloading files), our servers or service providers may receive basic technical information such as:
- IP address
- Timestamp of the request
- Requested URL/resource
- User-agent / app version (if sent)
- Basic error codes

This is common for hosting and content delivery and is generally required to operate downloads/updates securely.

### D. Optional diagnostics (crash reports / telemetry)
Depending on your App version, the App may offer **optional** diagnostic collection such as crash reports (e.g., stack traces, error logs) and basic device/app info (OS version, App version, architecture).

If diagnostics are enabled, we aim to exclude prompt content and model outputs. However, logs can sometimes contain sensitive information depending on your configuration and usage. Review any support bundle before sending.

## 3) How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve the App and Services
- Deliver updates and downloads
- Respond to support requests
- Prevent abuse, fraud, and security issues
- Process purchases and subscriptions (if/when offered)
- Comply with legal obligations

---

## 4) Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information in limited circumstances:
- **Service providers** (hosting, download delivery, error monitoring, payment processors if paid plans exist). They may process data on our behalf under contractual restrictions.
- **Legal and safety** (to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights, prevent fraud/abuse, or address security issues).
- **Business transfers** (if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction).

### Third-party models and licenses
The App may help you download or run third-party models, weights, tokenizers, or tools. Those third parties may have their own privacy practices and license terms. We are not responsible for third-party practices.

---

## 5) Payments (Future)
If we offer paid features, purchases will typically be handled by a payment processor. We would receive limited billing-related information (for example: customer email, subscription status, and transaction identifiers). We generally do **not** receive full credit card numbers.

When paid features launch, we may update this Policy with specific payment details.

---

## 6) Data Retention
- **Local data:** Prompts/outputs/history stored by the App remain on your device until you delete them (or uninstall the App), subject to your settings.
- **Support communications:** We may retain support emails and attachments for as long as necessary to address the request and maintain business records.
- **Server logs:** Requests to download/update endpoints may be retained for a limited time for security and operational purposes.

---

## 7) Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. No system is 100% secure; you are responsible for securing your device and any sensitive data you process locally.

---

## 8) Your Choices and Controls
Depending on your App version, you may be able to:
- Disable optional diagnostics (if offered)
- Control whether chat history or logs are stored locally
- Delete local data (history, cached files, downloaded artifacts)
- Choose whether to send support bundles/logs

---

## 9) Children’s Privacy
InferenceDesk is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required by your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 10) International Users
If you access the Services from outside the United States, information may be processed in the United States or other locations where we or our service providers operate.

---

## 11) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Policy and update the Effective Date. Your continued use of the App after the effective date means you accept the updated Policy.
