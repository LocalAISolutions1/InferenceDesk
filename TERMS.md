**Product:** InferenceDesk Desktop Application and related services (the “App” / “Services”)  
**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Acceptance of These Terms
By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the App.

If you use the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization. In that case, “you” and “your” refer to the organization.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be legally able to enter into a binding agreement where you live. You are responsible for ensuring your use of the App complies with applicable laws and regulations.

## 3. The App and Services
InferenceDesk is a desktop application intended to help users run local, on-device inference workflows using machine learning models and related components that may be provided by third parties, including open-source publishers (“Third-Party Items”). Local AI Solutions does not own or control Third-Party Items.

The App may include features such as model import tools, configuration and runtime utilities, a prompt interface, local endpoints/APIs, logs, integrations, update mechanisms, licensing controls for paid features, and other functionality. Features may change over time.

## 4. License Grant
Subject to these Terms, Local AI Solutions grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the App for your personal use or internal business purposes on devices you own or control.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Local AI Solutions.

## 5. Restrictions
You agree not to:
- Copy, distribute, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or transfer the App except as permitted by law or in writing by us.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.
- Circumvent or disable security, licensing, access controls, or technical protections.
- Use the App to engage in unlawful conduct, or to generate, store, or distribute unlawful content.
- Interfere with or disrupt the App or Services, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to related systems.

## 6. Third-Party Items (Models, Tools, Licenses)
The App may help you locate, download, import, manage, or run Third-Party Items. Third-Party Items are governed by their own licenses and terms. You are solely responsible for:
- Confirming you have the rights to obtain and use any Third-Party Items;
- Complying with all applicable third-party licenses, attribution requirements, distribution restrictions, and usage policies;
- Determining whether a Third-Party Item is appropriate, safe, and lawful for your use case (including commercial use).

Local AI Solutions is not responsible for Third-Party Items and makes no guarantees regarding their quality, performance, availability, legality, or suitability.

## 7. Your Content and Responsibility
You may provide inputs to the App (such as prompts, text, files, and code) and receive outputs from Third-Party Items (collectively, “Your Content”). You are responsible for Your Content, including ensuring you have rights to use any inputs you provide.

As between you and Local AI Solutions:
- You retain ownership of your inputs.
- Local AI Solutions does not claim ownership of your inputs.
- Outputs may be subject to Third-Party Item license terms and applicable law; Local AI Solutions does not guarantee any particular ownership outcome for outputs.

You are responsible for reviewing outputs before using them. Do not rely on outputs for medical, legal, financial, safety-critical, or compliance-sensitive decisions without appropriate professional review.

## 8. Privacy and Connectivity
Our handling of personal data (if any) is described in the **Privacy Policy** located at `./PRIVACY.md` (and/or on our website, if provided).

The App is intended to run locally, but some features may involve network connections (for example, checking for updates, optional telemetry/crash reports, model browsing, license verification for paid features, or optional connected services). Where feasible, we will describe these features and provide controls.

## 9. Updates; Changes to the App or Terms
We may provide patches, updates, upgrades, or new versions. Some updates may be required for security or compatibility.

We may update these Terms by posting an updated version in this repository and/or on our website. If you continue using the App after updated Terms take effect, you agree to the updated Terms.

## 10. Support
We may offer support resources (documentation, community channels, and/or email support). Support is provided on an “as available” basis and may change or be discontinued.

## 11. Paid Features, Billing, and Purchases
The App may offer paid features, subscriptions, or one-time purchases now or in the future (“Paid Features”).

If you purchase Paid Features:
- **Pricing and Plan Terms:** Prices, features, and billing intervals will be shown at purchase or within the App.
- **Payment Authorization:** You authorize us and our payment processor to charge your payment method for fees, applicable taxes, and any recurring charges.
- **Auto-Renewal Subscriptions:** Subscriptions may automatically renew unless you cancel prior to renewal. Cancellation and renewal details will be provided at checkout or in the App.
- **Plan or Price Changes:** We may change plan features or pricing for future periods. If changes apply to an existing subscription, we will provide notice where required by law.
- **Taxes:** You are responsible for any applicable taxes, duties, or government assessments, except where we are required to collect them.
- **Refunds:** Payments are non-refundable except where required by law or where a refund policy is presented at purchase.
- **Marketplace Purchases:** If purchased through an app store or marketplace, that provider’s billing and refund terms may apply.

If you provide ideas, suggestions, or feedback, you grant Local AI Solutions a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate that feedback without compensation or obligation to you.

## 14. Disclaimers
THE APP AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LOCAL AI SOLUTIONS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE.

## 15. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LOCAL AI SOLUTIONS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE APP, SERVICES, OR THIRD-PARTY ITEMS.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LOCAL AI SOLUTIONS’ TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF:
- (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO LOCAL AI SOLUTIONS FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR
- (B) $100.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so these limitations apply only to the extent permitted by law.

## 16. Indemnification

- Your violation of any law or third-party rights.

## 17. Termination
You may stop using the App at any time.

We may suspend or terminate access to Services (if any) or revoke your license to use the App if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms or if required by law. Upon termination, you must stop using the App and delete all copies in your control, except where applicable law allows continued possession.

## 18. Export Controls and Sanctions
You agree to comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws. You represent that you are not prohibited from receiving or using the App under such laws.

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Florida**, excluding conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **[COUNTY/REGION, STATE]**, and you consent to jurisdiction and venue there.

## 20. Miscellaneous
- **Severability:** If any provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
